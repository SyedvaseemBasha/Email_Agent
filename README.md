# AI Email Response Agent

This project is an AI-powered email response agent that automatically generates replies to incoming emails. It leverages a large language model (LLM) to understand the context of emails and craft relevant, professional responses. The system also includes features for storing responses, collecting user feedback, and providing dashboard statistics.

## Features

-   **Automated Email Response:** Uses the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 LLM to generate intelligent responses to email queries.
-   **Response Time Tracking:** Measures and records the time taken to generate each response.
-   **Accuracy Evaluation:** Employs an accuracy evaluation mechanism to assess the quality of the generated responses.
-   **User Feedback:** Allows users to provide feedback on the accuracy and quality of the responses.
-   **Data Storage:** Stores email queries, AI responses, response times, and accuracy ratings in a MongoDB database.
-   **Email Sending:** Sends the AI-generated response back to the email recipient.
-   **Admin Dashboard:** Provides statistics on total responses, average response time, average accuracy, and accuracy distribution.
-   **Recipient Email Extraction:** Attempts to extract the recipient's email from the body of the email.
-   **Asynchronous Operations:** Uses background tasks to handle database storage and email sending without blocking the main application flow.

## Technologies Used

-   **FastAPI:** For building the web API.
-   **Uvicorn:** For running the ASGI server.
-   **MongoDB:** For storing email data and feedback.
-   **Motor:** For asynchronous MongoDB operations.
-   **LangChain:** For interacting with the LLM.
-   **Hugging Face Transformers:** For the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 model.
-   **FastAPI Mail:** For sending emails.
-   **Python-dotenv:** For managing environment variables.
-   **Pydantic:** For data validation and settings management.
-   **Torch:** For tensor operations with the LLM.
-   **Accelerate:** For model acceleration.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd Email
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Environment Variables:**

    -   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
    -   Add the following environment variables (replace with your actual values):

    ```properties
    # MongoDB Configuration
    MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
    DB_NAME=email_response_agent

    # Email Configuration
    MAIL_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
    MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
    MAIL_FROM=your_email@gmail.com
    MAIL_PORT=587
    MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
    MAIL_FROM_NAME=AI Email Assistant
    MAIL_STARTTLS=True
    MAIL_SSL_TLS=False
    USE_CREDENTIALS=True

    # Model Configuration
    MODEL_NAME=mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1
    MODEL_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key
    ```
    -   **Note:** For `MAIL_PASSWORD`, if you are using Gmail, you **must** create an app password. Here's how:
        1.  **Enable 2-Step Verification:** Go to your Google Account settings and enable 2-Step Verification if you haven't already.
        2.  **Go to App Passwords:** Once 2-Step Verification is enabled, go to the "App passwords" section in your Google Account security settings (you can search for "app passwords" in the Google Account search bar).
        3.  **Select App and Device:** Choose "Mail" as the app and "Other (Custom name)" as the device. Enter a name like "AI Email Agent" and click "Generate."
        4.  **Copy the App Password:** Google will generate a 16-character app password. **Copy this password** and paste it into your `.env` file as the value for `MAIL_PASSWORD`.
        5. **Important:** Store this password in a safe place. You will not be able to see it again.
    -   **Note:** For `MODEL_API_KEY`, you need to create a Hugging Face account and get an API key from your settings.

5.  **Run MongoDB:**

    -   Ensure that MongoDB is running on your local machine (or update `MONGODB_URL` in `.env` if using a remote instance).

6.  **Run the Application:**

    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```

    -   This will start the FastAPI application. You can access the API at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
